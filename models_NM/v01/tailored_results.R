# Selected results

## Idea:
# 1. After running evolutionary analysis.R
# 2. Pick the resulting object (i.e. "results")
# 3. Use it to build tailored outputs.

## A table to compare models
# Compare BM, single OU, multi OU
# For both G and M
# Include relevant numbers such as:
# - AIC
# - What else?

## Nicer trees
# Better colours
