# Selected results

## Idea:
# 1. After running evolutionary analysis.R
# 2. Pick the resulting object (i.e. "results")
# 3. Use it to build tailored outputs.

## A table to compare models
# Compare BM, single OU, multi OU
# For both G and M
# Include relevant numbers such as:
# - AIC
# - What else?

## Nicer trees
# Better colours
# I don't like the colours
# Titles lack the pointer to the trait name. Anyway, I may get rid of titles altogether
# Remove "NA" from legend
# Considering (not sure) to add alpha besides theta
# The numeric scale at the bottom is meaningless
# I think it needs thicker lines
# For some reason, the smaller display sinked to RStudio visual device looks better thant the sinked output. No idea why.

## Regimes
# Summaries already have thetha and logit(theta).
# I think we may also need alpha and other numbers. Maybe checkout what papers normally report.
# Curiously, it seems like ´$parameters´ is empty (return NAs)
# Read surface documentation to figure out what are does values stored at n_regimes: k, kprime, deltak, etc.
# Regimes dist (plot) is nice, but that should just go on a table (?)
