abstract = {This paper explores contradictions between state and local discourses over the origins of Chile's ‘agricultural communities' (comunidades agr{\'{i}}colas). An ‘indigenous history' constructed through the authoritative voice of economic development and environmental policy is contrasted with local identification with the Chilean cowboy and copper mining culture. I argue that the influence of labour unions and state-peasant relations (the political economy in which the communities developed) and the complexities of family economic subsistence strategies in a region of scarce resources (the political ecology in which their livelihood is reproduced) must be considered as important factors in the incongruities presented by these competing histories and identities. ‘Policy-positioned ascriptions of ethnicity' and identity is my term for racial attributions engendered by proscriptive assistance that reifies images of a ‘non-capitalist Other' positioned in contrast to ideals of modernization.},

The study examines household asset levels, how asset levels affect the choice of agricultural practices, and how those practices affected natural resource status. The results show that human capital, physical capital in the forms of land and livestock, access to nonfarm employment, and access to agricultural credit and technical advice largely explain the adoption of irrigated forage production and woodlot plantings with resultant increases in vegetative cover (despite rising livestock populations).},

abstract = {The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process plays a major role in the analysis of the evolution of phenotypic traits along phylogenies. The standard OU process includes random perturbations and stabilizing selection and assumes that species evolve independently. However, evolving species may interact through various ecological process and also exchange genes especially in plants. This is particularly true if we want to study phenotypic evolution among diverging populations within species. In this work we present a straightforward statistical approach with analytical solutions that allows for the inclusion of adaptation and migration in a common phylogenetic framework, which can also be useful for studying local adaptation among populations within the same species. We furthermore present a detailed simulation study that clearly indicates the adverse effects of ignoring migration. Similarity between species due to migration could be misinterpreted as very strong convergent evolution without proper correction for these additional dependencies. Finally, we show that our model can be interpreted in terms of ecological interactions between species, providing a general framework for the evolution of traits between “interacting” species or populations.},

abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous‐valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least‐squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal $\alpha$= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch‐length transformations, one based on the Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life‐history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25% of traits) and/or ACDC (40%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

abstract = {Abstract: Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model selection directly. We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein?Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein?Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximum?likelihood?based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations.},

In this paper, we reevaluate this pattern using a new technique in cross-cultural analyses that effectively controls for the nonindependence of cultures (Galton's problem) through the identification of independent instances of cultural change (Mace and Pagel 1994). First, we produce cultural phylogenetic trees for the societies under study, from phylogenies previously constructed on the basis of linguistic similarity (Ruhlen 1987). Then, following standard methods for the analysis of discrete characters on phylogenetic trees, we use parsimony to determine the ancestral condition of both marriage and inheritance, and subsequently tally the number of independent instances of cultural change in each trait. The results show that transitions to polygyny are much more commonly associated with male-biased inheritance than are transitions to monogamy across human societies in our sample. They illustrate how the degree of change in the evolution of these traits differs considerably between divergent cultural groups. The advantages of this technique are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract: The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, ?, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species? traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show ? to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, ? is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty?eight percent of data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60% of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter ? be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.},

abstract = {abstract: Two phylogenetic comparative methods, independent contrasts and generalized least squares models, can be used to determine the statistical relationship between two or more traits. We show that the two approaches are functionally identical and that either can be used to make statistical inferences about values at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree (hypothetical ancestors), to estimate relationships between characters, and to predict values for unmeasured species. Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass?corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade. These differences may justify separate, clade?specific allometric equations for prediction of avian basal metabolic rates.},

abstract = {Comparative studies tend to differ from optimality and functionality studies in how they treat adaptation. While the comparative approach focuses on the origin and change of traits, optimality studies assume that adaptations are maintained at an optimum by stabilizing selection. This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima. The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints not only lead to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed.},

In this context, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is now being used extensively to model selectively driven trait evolution, whereby a trait is attracted to a selection optimum ?. We report here theoretical properties of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators for these parameters, including their non-uniqueness and inaccuracy, and show that theoretical expectations indeed apply to real trees. We provide necessary conditions for ML estimators to be well defined and practical implications for model parametrization. We then show how these limitations carry over to difficulties in detecting shifts in selection regimes along a phylogeny. When the phylogenetic placement of these shifts is unknown, we identify a ?large p - small n? problem where traditional model selection criteria fail and favour overly complex scenarios. Instead, we propose a modified criterion that is better adapted to change-point models. The challenges we identify here are inherent to trait evolution models on phylogenetic trees when observations are limited to present-day taxa, and require the addition of fossil taxa to be alleviated. We conclude with recommendations for empiricists.},

A total of 1898 STR profiles representing 28,470 loci and more than 42,000 alleles were analyzed with 100% concordance. GeneMarker HID was also used to successfully analyze data generated from a custom STR multiplex, with simplified and rapid implementation. Finally, the impact of the user-friendly design features of the software was assessed through a time scale study. The results suggest that laboratories can reduce the time required for data analysis by at least 25% when using GeneMarker HID.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are believed to contain a wealth of information on diversification processes. Comparing phylogenetic trees is not straightforward due to their high dimensionality. Researchers have therefore defined a wide range of one-dimensional summary statistics. However, it remains unexplored to what extent these summary statistics cover the same underlying information and what summary statistics best explain observed variation across phylogenies. Furthermore, a large subset of available summary statistics focusses on measuring the topological features of a phylogenetic tree, but are often only explored at the extreme edge cases of the fully balanced or unbalanced tree and not for trees of intermediate balance.Here, we introduce a new R package that provides speed optimized code to compute 54 summary statistics. We study correlations between summary statistics on empirical trees and on trees simulated using several diversification models. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to create intermediately balanced trees in a well-defined manner, in order to explore variation in summary statistics across a balance gradient.We find that almost all summary statistics are correlated with tree size, and it is difficult if not impossible to correct for tree size, unless the tree generating model is known. Furthermore, we find that across empirical and simulated trees, at least two large clusters of correlated summary statistics can be found, where statistics group together based on information used (topology or branching times). However, the finer grained correlation structure appears to depend strongly on either the taxonomic group studied (in empirical studies) or the diversification model (in simulation studies). Nevertheless, we can identify multiple groups of summary statistics that are strongly and consistently correlated, indicating that these statistics measure the same underlying property of a tree. Lastly, we find that almost all topological summary statistics vary non-linearly and sometimes even non-monotonically with our intuitive balance gradient.Therefore, in order to avoid introducing biases and missing underlying information, we advocate for selecting as many summary statistics as possible in phylogenetic analyses. With the introduction of the treestats package, which provides fast and reliable calculations, such an approach is now routinely possible.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the use of phylogenetic methods to study the evolution of languages and culture. Languages fit a tree model of evolution well, at least in their basic vocabulary, challenging the view that blending, or admixture among neighbouring groups, was predominant in cultural history. Here, we argue that we can use language trees to test hypotheses about not only cultural history and diversification, but also bio-cultural adaptation. Phylogenetic comparative methods take account of the non-independence of cultures (Galton's problem), which can cause spurious statistical associations in comparative analyses. Advances in phylogenetic methods offer new possibilities for the analysis of cultural evolution, including estimating the rate of evolution and the direction of coevolutionary change of traits on the tree. They also enable phylogenetic uncertainty to be incorporated into the analyses, so that one does not have to treat phylogenetic trees as if they were known without error.},

abstract = {Understanding how systems of political and economic inequality evolved from relatively egalitarian origins has long been a focus of anthropological inquiry. Many hypotheses have been suggested to link socio-ecological features with the rise and spread of inequality, and empirical tests of these hypotheses in prehistoric and extant societies are increasing. In this review, we synthesize several streams of theory relevant to understanding the evolutionary origins, spread, and adaptive significance of inequality. We argue that while inequality may be produced by a variety of localized processes, its evolution is fundamentally dependent on the economic defensibility and transmissibility of wealth. Furthermore, these properties of wealth could become persistent drivers of inequality only following a shift to a more stable climate in the Holocene. We conclude by noting several key areas for future empirical research, emphasizing the need for more analyses of contemporary shifts toward institutionalized inequality as well as prehistoric cases.},

abstract = {The genetic trait of lactase persistence (LP) evolved as an adaptation to milking pastoralism in the Old World and is a well-known example of positive natural selection in humans. However, the specific mechanisms conferring this selective advantage are unknown. To understand the relationship between milk drinking, LP, growth, reproduction, and survival, communities of the Coquimbo Region in Chile, with recent adoption of milking agropastoralism, were used as a model population. DNA samples and data on stature, reproduction, and diet were collected from 451 participants. Lactose tolerance tests were done on 41 of them. The European −13,910*T (rs4988235) was the only LP causative variant found, showing strong association (99.6%) with LP phenotype. Models of associations of inferred LP status and milk consumption, with fertility, mortality, height, and weight were adjusted with measures of ancestry and relatedness to control for population structure. Although we found no statistically significant effect of LP on fertility, a significant effect (P = 0.002) was observed of LP on body mass index (BMI) in males and of BMI on fertility (P = 0.003). These results fail to support a causal relationship between LP and fertility yet suggest the idea of a nutritional advantage of LP. Furthermore, the proportion of European ancestry around the genetic region of −13,910*T is significantly higher (P = 0.008) than the proportion of European ancestry genome-wide, providing evidence of recent positive selection since European–Amerindian admixture. This signature was absent in nonpastoralist Latin American populations, supporting the hypothesis of specific adaptation to milking agropastoralism in the Coquimbo communities.},

abstract = {Wealthy contemporary societies exhibit varying extents of economic inequality, with the Nordic countries being relatively egalitarian, whereas there is a much larger gap between top and bottom in the United States. Borgerhoff Mulder et al. (p. 682; see the Perspective by Acemoglu and Robinson) build a bare-bones model describing the intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth?based on social networks, land and livestock, and physical and cognitive capacity?in four types of small-scale societies in which livelihoods depended primarily on hunting, herding, farming, or horticulture. Parameter estimates from a large-scale analysis of historical and ethnographic data were added to the model to reveal that the four types of societies display distinctive patterns of wealth transmission and that these patterns are associated with different extents of inequality. Some types of wealth are strongly inherited and, hence, contribute to long-term economic inequality. Small-scale human societies range from foraging bands with a strong egalitarian ethos to more economically stratified agrarian and pastoral societies. We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model in which a population?s long-run steady-state level of inequality depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute to this pattern.},

abstract = {Kinship terminologies are the semantic systems of language that express kinship relations between individuals: in English, ‘aunt' denotes a parent's sister. Theoretical models of kinship terminology diversity reduce over 10 billion possible organisations to six key types, each of which are hypothesised to be aligned with particular cultural norms of descent, marriage or residence patterns. Often, terminological type is used to infer social patterns in past societies based on these putative relationships between kinship terminologies and social structure, and these associations are staples of ‘Anthropology 101'. However, these relationships have not been scrutinised using modern comparative methods. Here we show that kinship terminologies vertically track language phylogeny in Austronesian, Bantu and Uto-Aztecan, three languages families of different time-depths and environments. We find no unidirectional or universal models of evolution in kinship terminology. Of 18 existing anthropological coevolutionary theories regarding kinship terminology and cultural practices across 176 societies, we find only patchy support, and no evidence for putative universal drivers of evolution in kinship terminologies.},

However, the presence of large amounts of nonhuman DNA (up to 90% of the total extracted DNA) in saliva samples does necessitate DNA quantitation methods that are specific for human DNA. We were able to reliably and accurately type different genetic markers (mDNA sequences, Y-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and autosomal microsatellite loci) from saliva samples stored for up to 30 days at 37 degrees C, making this method well-suited for field conditions and convenient transportation of samples back to the laboratory.

@article{Savary2021,
abstract = {Abstract In landscape genetics, habitat connectivity and population genetic structure have been analysed using graph-theoretic approaches to understand how landscape features influence demography (i.e. dispersal and population size). Despite substantial advances in enhancing both genetic and landscape graph use, a software tool bringing together a large range of construction and analysis parameters for these two types of graphs was lacking in the landscape genetic toolbox. Moreover, although these two types of graphs appear complementary for answering landscape genetic questions, methods for comparing them have not been forthcoming. We have developed an R package to improve and encourage the use of these graphs. It includes functions for converting and importing genetic data and for genetic distance computing. It also implements time-efficient geodesic and cost-distance calculations from spatial data. A large range of parameters can be used to create genetic and landscape graphs from these data, including several graph pruning methods. We made available to R users the command-line facilitaties of Graphab software to easily model landscape graphs in R. The package functions perform preliminary analysis to adapt methodological choices to research questions. Landscape and genetic graphs created can be analysed with node-level metrics as well as link-level and modularity analyses. Users can compare and visualise these graphs and export them to shapefiles to facilitate interpretation and subsequent analyses. graph4lg contributes to expanding landscape and genetic graph potential for analysing ecological connectivity while encouraging further investigations on methodological implications related to these tools.},

abstract = {Summary:  phangorn is a package for phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis in the R language. Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence analyses.Availability:  phangorn can be obtained through the CRAN homepage http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html. phangorn is licensed under GPL 2.Contact:  klaus.kschliep@snv.jussieu.frSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {This paper uses data from eight past and present societies practicing intensive agriculture to measure the transmission of wealth across generations in preindustrial agricultural societies. Focusing on embodied, material, and relational forms of wealth, we compare levels of wealth between parents and children to estimate how effectively wealth is transmitted from one generation to the next and how inequality in one generation impacts inequality in the next generation. We find that material wealth is by far the most important, unequally distributed, and highly transmitted form of wealth in these societies, while embodied and relational forms of wealth show much weaker importance and transmission. We conclude that the unique characteristics of material wealth, and especially wealth in land, are key to the high and persistent levels of inequality seen in societies practicing intensive agriculture. We explore the implications of our findings for the evolution of inequality in the course of human history and suggest that it is the intensification of agriculture and the accompanying transformation of land into a form of heritable wealth that may allow for the social complexity long associated with agricultural societies.},

abstract = {We report quantitative estimates of intergenerational transmission and population?wide inequality for wealth measures in a set of hunter?gatherer populations. Wealth is defined broadly as factors that contribute to individual or household well?being, ranging from embodied forms, such as weight and hunting success, to material forms, such as household goods, as well as relational wealth in exchange partners. Intergenerational wealth transmission is low to moderate in these populations but is still expected to have measurable influence on an individual?s life chances. Wealth inequality (measured with Gini coefficients) is moderate for most wealth types, matching what qualitative ethnographic research has generally indicated (if not the stereotype of hunter?gatherers as extreme egalitarians). We discuss some plausible mechanisms for these patterns and suggest ways in which future research could resolve questions about the role of wealth in hunter?gatherer social and economic life.},

abstract = {Convergent evolution is central to the study of life's evolutionary history. Researchers have documented the ubiquity of convergence and have used this ubiquity to make inferences about the nature of limits on evolution. However, these inferences are compromised by unrecognized inconsistencies in the definitions, measures, significance tests and inferred causes of convergent evolution. I review these inconsistencies and provide recommendations for standardizing studies of convergence. A fundamental dichotomy exists between definitions that describe convergence as a pattern and those that describe it as a pattern caused by a particular process. When this distinction is not acknowledged it becomes easy to assume that a pattern of convergence indicates that a particular process has been active, leading researchers away from alternative explanations. Convergence is not necessarily caused by limits to evolution, either adaptation or constraint; even substantial amounts of convergent evolution can be generated by a purely stochastic process. In the absence of null models, long lists of examples of convergent events do not necessarily indicate that convergence or any evolutionary process is ubiquitous throughout the history of life. Pattern-based definitions of convergence, coupled with quantitative measures and null models, must be applied before drawing inferences regarding large-scale limits to evolution.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) is one of the most commonly employed phylogenetic comparative methods. The technique, a modification of generalised least squares, uses knowledge of phylogenetic relationships to produce an estimate of expected covariance in cross-species data. Closely related species are assumed to have more similar traits because of their shared ancestry and hence produce more similar residuals from the least squares regression line. By taking into account the expected covariance structure of these residuals, modified slope and intercept estimates are generated that can account for interspecific autocorrelation due to phylogeny. Here, we provide a basic conceptual background to PGLS, for those unfamiliar with the approach. We describe the requirements for a PGLS analysis and highlight the packages that can be used to implement the method. We show how phylogeny is used to calculate the expected covariance structure in the data and how this is applied to the generalised least squares regression equation. We demonstrate how PGLS can incorporate information about phylogenetic signal, the extent to which closely related species truly are similar, and how it controls for this signal appropriately, thereby negating concerns about unnecessarily ‘correcting' for phylogeny. In addition to discussing the appropriate way to present the results of PGLS analyses, we highlight some common misconceptions about the approach and commonly encountered problems with the method. These include misunderstandings about what phylogenetic signal refers to in the context of PGLS (residuals errors, not the traits themselves), and issues associated with unknown or uncertain phylogeny.},

This question has engaged anthropologists for more than a century, with little consensus regarding the answer. We develop and fit autologistic models, built upon both spatial and linguistic neighbor graphs, for 44 cultural traits of 172 societies in the Western North American Indian (WNAI) database. For each trait, we compare models including or excluding one or both neighbor graphs, and for the majority of traits we find strong evidence in favor of a model which uses both spatial and linguistic neighbors to predict a trait's distribution. Our results run counter to the assertion that cultural trait distributions can be explained largely by the transmission of traits from parent to daughter populations and are thus best analyzed with phylogenies. In contrast, we show that vertical and horizontal transmission pathways can be incorporated in a single model, that both transmission modes may indeed operate on the same trait, and that for most traits in the WNAI database, accounting for only one mode of transmission would result in a loss of information.},

The paper documents the exposures and sensitivities faced by the community in light of current water shortages, and identifies their ability to manage these exposures under a changing climate. The IPCC identifies potentially increased aridity in this region with climate change; furthermore, the Elqui River is fed by snowmelt and glaciers, and its flows will be affected by a warming climate. Community vulnerability occurs within a broader physical, economic, political and social context, and vulnerability in the community varies amongst occupations, resource uses and accessibility to water resources, making some more susceptible to changing conditions in the future. This case study highlights the need for adaptation to current land and water management practices to maintain livelihoods in the face of changes many people are not expecting.},
